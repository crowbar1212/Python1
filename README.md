To my best understanding, program1 fulfills the following requirements for week3 prove:
    -Variables
    -Expressions
    -Conditionals
    -Functions
This program checks for user input and enters the numbers input to display disposable income, mortgage rates based on user selection. 

In order to replicate this program, do the following: 
    -Install Visual Studio Code
    -Install Python and Github extensions
    -Sign-in and connect to an existing Github account and repository
    -Set functions that take user input and perform algebraic functions to determine disposable income and mortgage rates seperately
    -To ensure that mortgage is displayed correctly, the function should follow the formula c = ((rp)/(1-(1+r)^(-n))
    -Total amount of interest paid is found as i = ((cn)-p)
